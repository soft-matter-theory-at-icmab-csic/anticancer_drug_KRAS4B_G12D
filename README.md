# anticancer_drug_KRAS4B_G12D

Initial coordinates of 5 systems used for exploring the interactions between drug LIG1 and oncogenic KRAS4B G12D mutant while anchoring to cell membrane.

Python and Tcl scripts used for MD analysis

A folder named "Binding-free-energy-calculation" is added for examples for biased force force calculations used in this project for calculating binding free-energy of LIG1 and its isomer with SII pocket of KRAS4B-G12D mutant on the PM.
